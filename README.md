What is Cosmic Countdown?

This game is a local multiplayer experience designed for 2 players. Both players spawn on a single map, with one of them starting as the “Bomber” of a bomb. The Bomber’s goal is to tag the other player—the “Runner”—to pass the bomb before it explodes. The Runner’s goal is to avoid getting tagged. 

Each player has 3 lives, and the first to lose all their lives is declared the loser, making the other player the winner. To keep the gameplay exciting, the Bomber moves faster than the Runner. 

Adding a unique twist, the game introduces gravity mechanics that allow players to run on walls, ceilings, and upside-down platforms. 

The gameplay also incorporates various items to give both players temporary advantages. For instance, players can pick up projectiles to slow down the opponent, traps to block paths, items to extend the bomb timer, or abilities to flip movement controls. These items activate upon pickup, forcing players to think strategically about their movements.

There is a total of 3 Maps to select through, and play with your friend. 

About this Project

This project was developed as part of a university assignment. The goal was to create either a small 2D or 3D game, or a simple game development tool within a few months. Unlike the previous assignment, which was a solo effort, this time we worked as a team.

We decided to create a 2D multiplayer game inspired by the concept of "hot potato." The development process included the use of several free assets, alongside custom assets created by our team to give the game its unique identity.

While this game is complete in its current form, future updates are possible but not guaranteed :)
